# Geass Anime Website

This project is a Geass Anime Website built using the MERN stack (HTML/CSS, React.js, Node.js, MongoDB). The website allows users to explore and manage their anime watchlist. It utilizes the Jikan API to fetch anime data.

- Delete Anime: Remove anime titles from your watchlist if you no longer plan to watch them.
- MongoDB: The backend of the Geass Anime Website utilizes MongoDB as the database to store and manage anime data.
- React: The frontend of the web app is built using React.js, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- Node.js / Express.js: The server-side of the application is developed using Node.js with Express.js, handling requests and managing the business logic.
